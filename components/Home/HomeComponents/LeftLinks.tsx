        Where we share one central theme, two or more questions, and one habit
        to stimulate your curiosity, self-exploration and interoception â€” all in
        the interest of supporting you in being better and shining more
        brightly. To be better requires empowerment to upgrade and reboot
        aspects of your personal operating system. Upgrades that allow for the
        more complete expression of your potential, personal transformations and
        the realization of peak experiences, more consistently.
